<h1>Ready To Graduate From Phd.</h1>

<p class="meta">23 Jul 2013 - Hefei</p>


<p>Yesterday, the school organized a great graduation ceremony for all the graduate students this year. My wife also came to Hefei to participate this ceremony as a compensation for i missed my bachelor graduation ceremony in 2006. Everything is so great, especially, when school president Hou says 'congratulation' to me, i feel the tears in my eyes.</p>

<p>Five years Phd. changes a lot of things. First of all, i have become a husband now, although i have not known how to become a perfect husband, but i do work really hard on this <strong>job</strong>. After this, i have finally found my dream at the very end of these five years. I would rather to be a not-so-rich innovator other than a millionaire worker; I would rather to be a professor other than a CXO in company; I would rather to think about problems in next 50~100 years other than solving people's diary problem. <strong>I want one day i can help to discover the intelligence and build the final artificial intelligence.</strong>Also, there are side changes during last five years. My parents are older and older, this fact always reminds me that i should try harder to make their hopes on me become reality. And in last three years, i lost two close relatives, This really gives me a sad impression about life. No body can avoid death, so, i hope my life is not just a waste of time to pursue money, comfort, or fame.</p>

<p>In next two years, i will have a post-doctoral experience in U.S. Living in a complete strange country is difficult and tough for me and my wife, but it would be also benefits us greatly as long as we can support each other with respect and love.</p>
